Exercise #6: More operators in the interpreter

scala> var x: Int = 3
 var y: Int = 7
 var z: Double = 5.5
var x: Int = 3

scala> var y: Int = 7

scala> var z: Double = 5.5

scala> import scala.language.postfixOps
 //a) Write an expression that provides the average of x and y
 var aver:Float = (x+y)/2

scala>
scala> there was 1 deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
1 warning found
var aver: Float = 5.0

//b) Write an expression that gives the remainder of a division of y by x
scala> var remainder: Float = y%x
there was 1 deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
1 warning found
var remainder: Float = 1.0


//c) Write an expression that adds x and y, divides this by z, and assigns the overall result to a new variable called result
scala> var result: Double = (x + y) / z
var result: Double = 1.8181818181818181

//d) Write an expression that subtracts x from z and then divides the result of this by y
scala> var subs: Double = (z - x) / y
var subs: Double = 0.35714285714285715

//h) Write an expression that increases x by 1 (note: this should actually update the value held by variable x, i.e. reassignment)
scala> x+=1

//i) Write an expression in the interpreter that decreases y by x
scala> var subs2: Int = y - x
var subs2: Int = 3

//j) Write an expression in the interpreter that multiplies y by 3
scala> var multiply: Int = y * 3
var multiply: Int = 21
